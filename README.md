CarsApp
=======
Our app allows a family of people to keep track of the cars they own (model, year, make, market value, mileage etcâ€¦). The different users, or family members, can be reminded of who is using a certain car, if maintenance is due on them and a list of issues to be fixed, and the cost of refueling based on the average gas market price. The user can also open a map view that indicates the closest gas station and service stations based on current location.
